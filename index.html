				<h1>Hi!</h1>
				<p>Hi there! Welcome to my website! I am a 14 year old coder, guitarist and an avid reader! I really like to make stuff <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/--explosion--">on scratch</a> and I like to code a bunch of 3d stuff in a software called <a href="https://blender.org">Blender</a>. Recently I have moved a way from scratch a little bit and worked more on coding in python and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. You can find my projects over <a href="https://github.com/explosion-scratch">on my GitHub account</a>. In my spare time I like to code, read, play guitar, and.... Code more. ðŸ¤¦ Right now I am working with a few other scratchers to code an amaging (<i>okay</i>, of course I'd think that) browser extension. It pretty much gives you scratch superpowers! This includes searching blocks, seeing how much a project is loaded, viewing deleted comments and much more! You can check that out over on the <a href="https://explosion-scratch.github.io/scratchaddons.github.io">ScratchAddons official website</a> or on the <a href="https://github.com/scratchaddons/scratchaddons">GitHub repository</a> for it.
